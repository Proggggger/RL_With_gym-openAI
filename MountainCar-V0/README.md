DQN solution for MountainCar is not the best one, but it still works.

First problem with this task is that reward always -1 until we solve task, so 
we should modify reward to make learning process possible

because solution is not the best, i'm not providing pretrained DQN model, but it should achieve sume results after 50 iterations
(you could always disable render mode to make simulation quicker)
