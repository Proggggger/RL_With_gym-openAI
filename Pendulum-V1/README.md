# Inverted Pendulum task

Action space - one parameter Torque, value from _-2_ to _2_ 

This task has solution with:
* ___Deep Q learning method___
* ___DDPG method___

### Deep Q Learning
For this case we have only one control parameter, but as DQN network supports only choosing from list of parameters, list of parameter values was generated by dividing action space on few parts of same size _(5 in this example)_, 
and network chooses from this list, in example list contain 9 values in list, making more parameters will make calculations more percise

also notebook contains code for testing pretrained net, but be careful, training your own net will OVERWRITE existing weights,
so comment code for saving if you don't want to overwrite

### DDPG solution

This method is more suitable for solving this task because this method allows to use continuous action space and allows to achieve better 
accuracy for task solution. Task is pretty simple so network architectures are pretty simple - just feed-forward networks with **RElU**
 activations (*Actor* net has also **Tanh** activation, and *Critic* network has input on second layer).
