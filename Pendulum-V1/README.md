This task has solution with Deep Q learning method

For this case we have only one control parameter, but as DQN network supports only choosing from list of parameters, list of parameter values was generated, 
and network chooses from this list, in example list contain 9 values in list, making more parameters will make calculations more percise

also notebook contains code for testing pretrained net, but be careful, training your own net will OVERWRITE existing weights,
so comment code for saving if you don't want to overwrite
